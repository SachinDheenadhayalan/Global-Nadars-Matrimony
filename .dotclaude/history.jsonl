{"display":"replace the numbers under Our Success Stories with a \"#\" and make it's color the gradient you used for the logo. Make the Login, Register Now, and Get Started Now buttons also have that sane gradient color. Make it when scrolling the header has a background so it doesnt overlap with the other text when scrolling. When in mobile mode, make the menu that comes when clicking on the 3 lines right aligned and make it emerge from the right with a simple annimation.
