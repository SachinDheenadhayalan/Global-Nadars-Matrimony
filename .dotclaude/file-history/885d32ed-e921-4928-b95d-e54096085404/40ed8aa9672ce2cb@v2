- Installed and configured

### 2. Firebase Configuration
- **File**: `/src/lib/firebase.ts`
- Authentication, Firestore, and Storage initialized

## 🔐 Firebase Console Setup Required

To make authentication work, you need to enable it in your Firebase Console:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: **log-in-testing-1e3f0**
3. Navigate to **Authentication** → **Sign-in method**
4. Enable **Email/Password** authentication
5. Click **Save**

### Firestore Database Setup

1. In Firebase Console, go to **Firestore Database**
2. Click **Create database**
3. Choose **Start in production mode** (recommended)
4. Select a location
5. Click **Enable**

### Security Rules (Firestore)

Add these rules in Firestore Rules tab:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users collection
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

## 📊 Firestore Data Structure

When a user registers, the following data is stored in `users/{uid}`:

```javascript
{
  uid: string,
  fullName: string,
  email: string,
  mobile: string,
  gender: "male" | "female",
  dateOfBirth: string,
  age: number,
  profileStatus: "pending",
  isActive: true,
  isPremium: false,
  createdAt: ISO timestamp,
  updatedAt: ISO timestamp
}
```

## 🧪 Testing the Authentication

### Test Registration:
1. Go to `/register`
2. Fill in all required fields
3. Click "Register Now"
4. You should see "Registration successful!" alert
5. You'll be redirected to `/login`

### Test Login:
1. Go to `/login`
2. Enter the email and password you just registered
3. Click "Login"
4. You should be redirected to the home page

## 🛠️ Error Handling

Both pages include comprehensive error handling:

### Login Errors:
- Invalid email
- User not found
- Wrong password
- Invalid credentials
- User disabled

### Registration Errors:
- Email already in use
- Invalid email
- Weak password
- Password mismatch
- Operation not allowed

## 🔄 What Happens After Login?

Currently, after successful login:
- User is redirected to home page (`/`)
- Firebase auth state is maintained
- User stays logged in across page refreshes

## 📝 Next Steps

You can now:
1. **Enable Email/Password auth** in Firebase Console
2. **Create Firestore database**
3. **Test registration and login**
4. **View registered users** in Firebase Console → Authentication
5. **View user data** in Firebase Console → Firestore Database

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- User dashboard page
- Profile editing
- Extended registration form (education, family details, etc.)
- Profile photo upload
- Match suggestions
- Search and filter functionality
- Admin panel
